## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Mila and University of Montreal supervised by Professor Irina Rish. My research focuses on representation learning, abstract concept learning, and generalization in large-scale systems. My goal is to understand how large-scale deep learning systems are very useful in compressing data and learning useful abstract representations, especially in un/self-supervised manner. I am also interested in making these models robust in data distribution shifts, similar to human beings.
